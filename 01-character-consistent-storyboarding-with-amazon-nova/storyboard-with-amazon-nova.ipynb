    "# Character Consistent Storyboarding with Amazon Nova\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create character-consistent storyboards using Amazon Nova Canvas and Amazon Nova Reel on Amazon Bedrock. We'll explore prompt engineering techniques to maintain visual consistency across multiple scenes.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Storyboarding is a critical visualization tool in content production across filmmaking, animation, advertising, and UX design. While generative AI models like Amazon Nova Canvas and Nova Reel can generate concepts quickly, maintaining consistent character designs and stylistic coherence across scenes remains challenging.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "- Appropriate IAM permissions for Bedrock\n",
    "- The required Python packages (installed in the first cell)"

    "3. Using the same seed value for all image generations\n",

    "For even greater character consistency, consider exploring the fine-tuning approach demonstrated in Part 2 of this series."
